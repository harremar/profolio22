                <p>Hello! My name is Marielle and I enjoy creating new things for the web. My interest in coding started back in 2018, junior year of highschool, where I was introduced to C++. I decided to take my interest in coding and apply it to my future career.</p>
                <p>Fast-forward to today, I am now a junior at IUPUI majoring in Informatics and Media Arts & Science with a specialization in web development. I have had the privilege to collaborate with my peers on projects and develope my own projects. I have learned many coding languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, etc throughout my 2 years at IUPUI. My main focus today is working on bigger projects and continuing to grow my skills in web development.</p>

                    <p>Code Ninjas is a place where kids can go and learn basic coding skills. They can create their own Roblox games, Minecraft modes, learn 3D printing, and much more. At this job it is my duty to watch the ninjas in the dojo and help them when they get stuck. There are also opportunities to run camps over the summer covering multiple topics.</p>
                    <p>Working here has helped me practice my game development skills. It has also helped me to become a better communicator to the ninjas and guide them through the steps to complete their game.</p>
